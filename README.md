#Ping-Pong
###Introduction to Programming
###Ping-pong test code review due 10/16/15

#### By _**David Diehr**_

## Description

This is a web page where the user is prompted to enter a number, and then the page displays every number up to that number. But, for multiples of three, the page prints "ping" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, the page prints "pong". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, the page prints "ping-pong". It's intent is to demonstrate my understanding of how to use loops, conditionals, and variables.
